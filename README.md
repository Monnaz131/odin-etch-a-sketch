# odin-etch-a-sketch

A sketchpad will be created to practice manipulating the DOM and to put on my portfolio.

Todos:
1. Create a 16x16 grid of square divs, inside of a container.
2. Create a hover effect so that the grid divs change color.
3. Let the user be able to change the color or mode, and to choose an eraser or to clear the page.
4. Let the user be able to change the grid size (max 100).
